# sedlak-challenge-13

## Description

For this challenge, we had to create the backend operations and routes for a shopping website.  These included seed data, routes and models for products, tags and categories for all.  I accomplished this using node, express, dotenv and mysql, then tested and made sure everything was working in Insomnia. Below are the links to my GitHub Repository and a walkthrough video showing how my code runs.

## Installation

I began by building out all of the information I would need in my models, then fixed my server and began building my associations and routes.  With my routes finished, I installed the necessary packages in my terminal, then ran my code through Insomnia to make sure that it was all functioning correctly.


## Usage

To use the code, open my file in the terminal and enter npm start.  Then once you see that the server is listening in localhost/3001, you can go in and test all of the routes.  There is a GET POST DELETE and PUT routes for Products, Tags and Categories.  Please see the video in the comments of my submission for a walkthrough of this functionality.

## Tests

I tested all of my routes in Insomnia.
